When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When I want to have an external back-up of my code;
- When I'm working on the same project with different computers;
- When I'm working on a project with other people (to share code).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I want to be aware of the changes introduced in the code I'm working on. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork clones a GitHub repository directly on GitHub, keeping a connection to the original repository.
Clone makes a local copy of a remote repository.
Branch create a variant of a given code, within a given repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

With this local copy, I can always check what is in the remote without an Internet connection, and it is easier to use standard Git commands such as git diff and git log.
